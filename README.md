Fix for custom artwork messing up after adding new mods <br>
Works only for adding new mods considering that before that everything was correct

## How to use:
1. [download the script](https://git-link.vercel.app/api/download?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FFieryFenX%2Fsourcemods-artworkfix%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fartworkfix.bat)
2. put the script into Steam\userdata\<userid>\config\grid
3. add only 1 new mod to your sourcemods folder $${\color{red}\*}$$
4. make sure the mod was added to Steam <br> (and that the artwork is indeed messed up)
5. launch the script
6. when prompted, select the latest mod you added
7. enjoy your corrected artwork
8. now you can repeat 3-7 as many times as you like

***

$${\color{red}\*}$$ note that the order of the mods in Steam is affected by the folder names, <br>
     so if you want to change the name of the mod folder, <br>
     do it before launching the script and never change again

Also, the script does not support fixing artwork after deleting the mod. <br>
If you want to remove the mod without breaking the artwork, hide it instead of deleting

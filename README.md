Fix for custom artwork messing after adding new mods <br>
Works only for adding new mods considering that before that everything was correct

## How to use:
1. put the script into Steam\userdata\<userid>\config\grid
2. add only 1 new mod to your sourcemods folder $${\color{red}\*}$$
3. launch the script
4. when prompted, select the latest mod you added
5. enjoy your corrected artwork
6. now you can repeat 2-5 as many times as you like

***

$${\color{red}\*}$$ note that the order of the mods in Steam is affected by the folder names, <br>
     so if you want to change the name of the mod folder, <br>
     do it before launching the sript and never change again

Also, the script does not support fixing artwork after deleting the mod. <br>
If you want to remove the mod without breaking the artwork, hide it instead of deleting
